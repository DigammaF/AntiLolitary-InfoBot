r/antilolitary is NOT a pro-pedo subreddit. The main purpose of this sub is to call out harassment from r/lolitary. Our community members DO NOT promote any illegal activities, calling the sub a pro pedo subreddit is defamation and harassment.

Our community strives to draw attention to all the numerous arguments supporting the fact that watching animes involving lolis/shotas has no connection of any kind with one's inclination to commit pedophile acts.

The r/antilolitary community is welcoming to anyone, regardless of their opinion on the matter, as long as they can express themselves without committing hate speech.
