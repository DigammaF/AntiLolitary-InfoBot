r/antilolitary is NOT a pro-pedo subreddit. The main purpose of this sub is to call out harassment from r/lolitary. Our community members believe that whatever one's beliefs are, harassment is NEVER an option. The good option is either a polite debate if possible, or authorities intervention if required. Since r/antilolitary only promotes one's freedom to watch (or not!) any anime they like and does ABSOLUTELY NOT promotes any illegal activities, calling it a pro pedo subreddit is defamation and harassment.
Furthermore, our community strives to draw attention to all the numerous arguments supporting the fact that watching animes involving lolis/shotas has no connection of any kind with one's inclination to commit pedophile acts.
Our stand about pedophilia is NOT about normalizing it, but rather about encouraging pedophiles to seek help to handle their urges. Please note, however, that the sub was not made to discuss pedophilia outside of the anime scope.
The r/antilolitary community is welcoming to anyone, regardless of their opinion on the matter, as long as they can express themselves without committing hate speech.
